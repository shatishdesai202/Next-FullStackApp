I’m positive my clients and regular readers would agree my slogan should be, “Consistency is key!” I preach it  and apply this principle to all areas of life; nutrition, exercise, career and relationships."

- Are you consistent in your life?

# Career

By having consistency in your career, I’m not talking about simply going into work everyday (although I highly recommend that!), I’m talking about being consistent in your efforts.

My overarching goal with my blog, is to consistently give women knowledgeable, needed and practical information on exercise, nutrition and living a healthy lifestyle.

If I were to post randomly and let weeks and months go by without actively posting, my audience will leave because they cannot count on it, or me. I consistently post a minimum of once a week and if I’m going on vacation, I write beforehand and schedule it. This is what I am here for, and I show up.

Being consistent in your career gains trust. When you consistently deliver a level of work or service, coworkers, managers, and/or clients know they can depend on you. When people depend on and trust you, you’re respected. Win-Win-Win!

# Relationships

We all have that group of friends from school that we are still friends with. We also have many friends – whom we may have been very close to years ago – but we haven’t thought about in decades. The difference is consistently keeping in touch (K.I.T for all those cool yearbook signers!).

With the power of social media, it’s insanely easy to reach out to friends and family, but actually being consistent and taking that action is crucial.

Ever since high school, my girlfriends and I call each other on our birthdays. This started before Facebook and Instagram and the like existed, and I am grateful for this consistent touchpoint.

Even if I haven’t seen them within that year – we’re scattered about the country now – I always make that call and I expect, and receive, a call from all of them when I’m the one celebrating.

Being consistent in your relationships requires a little effort, but is most rewarding. I’ve found, keeping true to those, “we should grab a coffee!” utterances is a huge help in keeping up with friends.

If I say, “we should go see a movie sometime”, or, “a double date would be fun!”, I send an email in the next few days suggesting a time or date. It doesn’t take much time, but keeps friendships strong. It’s also easier to make a habit because we leave one friend-date with the next one in the works.

Family relationships are a little different. We’re bonded to our family members in a certain way for life, and let the nature of holidays, reunions and other events be our constant.

Recently, my family started something new and I recommend it: a Facebook group. My parents, aunts, uncles, cousins – and recently – my grandma, has a closed Facebook group where we post little updates and photos. It’s a place we can share a glimpse into our everyday lives that don’t warrant a call or email, but are fun for all to see.
