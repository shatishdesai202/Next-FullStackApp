“If you are persistent, you will get it. If you are consistent, you will keep it.”

## How can I change my perception of stress?

Authentic meditation practice can help us change our perception of stress and our reaction to it. “Stress” is a catchall term that covers a variety of reactions to unwelcome circumstances, from anxiety to panic. When we allow stress to run the show, it impacts our bodies and our minds. We often use the word “stress,” meaning we often feel the pressure of having to deal with the difficult situations we find ourselves in.

It’s when we notice that we’re overwhelmed, when we notice the suffering, that we look for help. In many ways, stress is a good motivator; when something hurts, we’re going to try to fix it, to do something about it. At the same time, we can also try to prevent it from happening in the first place. And research has confirmed over and over again that certain meditation techniques both prevent stress and help us cope with it better.

### Furthermore, the way we respond or react emotionally, our capacity to regulate our emotions, will improve as well. Because that’s another effect of meditation that has been proven by neuroscience! Meditators handle stress better; we are less reactive to emotional stimuli and situations because we are less involved in the reality that we perceive. We don’t cling to it as strongly. And so naturally the way we cope with our emotions will be much more skillful. We will be less agitated and stressed, and we well know that when we are calmer, we can handle any crisis better. And vice versa. We also know that those who handle crises better are those who are better able to handle their emotions.
